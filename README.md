# TANZANIA-TOURISM-PREDICTION


The Tanzanian tourism sector plays a significant role in the Tanzanian economy, contributing about 17% to the countryâ€™s GDP and 25% of all  foreign exchange revenues. The sector, which provides direct employment for more than 600,000 people and up to 2 million people indirectly, generated approximately $2.4 billion in 2018 according to government statistics. Tanzania received a record 1.1 million international visitor arrivals in 2014, mostly from Europe, the US and Africa.

Tanzania is the only country in the world which has allocated more than 25% of its total area to wildlife, national parks, and protected 
areas. There are 16 national parks in Tanzania, 28 game reserves, 44 game-controlled areas, two marine parks and one conservation area.


Objective

The dataset describes 6476 rows of up-to-date information on tourist expenditure collected by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in 

Tanzania. The dataset was collected to gain a better understanding of the status of the tourism sector and provide an instrument that 

will enable sector growth.  Your goal is to accurately predict tourist expenditure when visiting Tanzania.

The objective of this Challenge is to develop a machine learning model to predict what a tourist will spend when visiting Tanzania. The 

model can be used by different tour operators and the Tanzania Tourism Board to automatically help tourists across the world estimate 

their expenditure before visiting Tanzania.
